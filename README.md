# Registration-Form

This project consists of an HTML, CSS, and JavaScript-based registration form that collects personal and identity details. The form is styled with a royal blue theme, and input fields are organized into rows with three fields each. The "Next" button triggers a JavaScript function that displays the entered data below the form. To use, simply place the files (`index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`) in the same directory and open `index.html` in a web browser. The form and its components can be easily customized by modifying the provided code.
